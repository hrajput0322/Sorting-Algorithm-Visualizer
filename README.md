# [Live App (click here)](https://sorting-algorithm-visualizer-eosin.vercel.app/)
This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer designed to provide a dynamic representation of various sorting algorithms. Built using React, it offers an interactive user interface where users can visualize the functioning of sorting algorithms in real-time. The project showcases algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each algorithm is implemented with color-coded bars representing elements in an array, allowing users to observe the sorting process step by step.

It's essential to note that while this visualizer accurately demonstrates the mechanics of sorting algorithms, it doesn't reflect the relative time complexity of these algorithms. The speed at which the bars move or change color is not indicative of the actual runtime performance of the algorithms. Instead, it serves as an educational tool to enhance understanding and intuition about how sorting algorithms operate.

Additionally, the time complexities mentioned on the site represent average-case time complexities, providing users with a general understanding of each algorithm's efficiency.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
